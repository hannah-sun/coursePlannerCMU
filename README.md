CoursePlanner allows students to have a clear visualization of their education path at CMU. Currently, the academic audit 

Students and advisors alike can use CoursePlanner to organize past courses and plan for the future all at once. Students can easily add past courses to their schedule history, and each course box includes the course code, course title, number of units. Moreover, when adding potential courses, students can easily see whether or not they have satisfied the prerequisites for the specified course. This is especially useful for students planning ahead to explore their options, and simplify the stressful process of course selection, without the need to sift through various different sites and course codes. Additionally, the pop up window gives students the full course description and information they would find on SIO, so there would be no need to navigate back and forth when using our app. 

One of the most significant features of our app is how it...
